# cc-and-rsquared
A statistical vignette tutorial/toolbox - part of Project EDDIE

This mini-module is meant to explain the concept of the correlation coefficient and the R-squared value. We want the Jupyter notebook to be two things: an exercise for students to complete, and also a toolbox for them to take with them going forward. 

*Students will need:*
- StatVignette01_R2_and_CC.ipynb - the jupyter notebook file
- icecreamdata.csv - a small dataset that is loaded and analyzed as part of the exercise
