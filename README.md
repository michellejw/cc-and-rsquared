# cc-and-rsquared
A statistical vignette tutorial/toolbox - part of Project EDDIE

This mini-module is meant to explain the concept of the correlation coefficient and the R-squared value. We want the Jupyter notebook to be two things: an exercise for students to complete, and also a toolbox for them to take with them going forward. 

* Main teaching notebook: StatVignette01_R2_and_CC.ipynb

This repository also contains a notebook used to generate the toy dataset used in the main teaching notebook.
